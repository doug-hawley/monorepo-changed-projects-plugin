## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

* **Unified change detection model** — replaced dual branch-mode/ref-mode with a single tag-based model anchored on `monorepo/last-successful-build`. The following DSL properties and tasks have been removed:
  * Removed `baseBranch` and `commitRef` from `monorepo { build { } }` — replaced by `lastSuccessfulBuildTag` and `primaryBranch`
  * Removed `releaseBranchPatterns` from `monorepo { release { } }` — the new aggregator task uses a `primaryBranch` guard instead
  * Removed `-Pmonorepo.commitRef` runtime override
  * Removed tasks: `printChangedProjectsFromBranch`, `printChangedProjectsFromRef`, `buildChangedProjectsFromBranch`, `buildChangedProjectsFromRef`, `writeChangedProjectsFromRef`, `createReleaseBranch` (per-subproject), `createReleaseBranchesForChangedProjects`

### Features

* add `primaryBranch` property on root `monorepo { }` extension (default: `"main"`)
* add `lastSuccessfulBuildTag` property for tag-based change detection (default: `"monorepo/last-successful-build"`)
* add unified `printChangedProjects` and `buildChangedProjects` tasks replacing 6 old tasks
* add `buildChangedProjectsAndCreateReleaseBranches` aggregator task with branch guard, atomic release branch creation, and automatic tag update
* add `AtomicReleaseBranchCreator` for two-phase branch creation with rollback on failure
* add `LastSuccessfulBuildTagUpdater` for automatic tag advancement after successful builds
